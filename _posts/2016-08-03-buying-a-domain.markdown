It seems like every developer worth their salt has a landing page with their name on it. I decided to take the quick and dirty approach of using a Digital Ocean droplet to serve a static page I spun up using Bootstrap.

# Step 1 Buying the domain

This step can be as easy as heading over to one of the big domain name registrars and wiping out your credit card. 

If you are the kind of person who's partial to tinfoil hats, and worried that the registrars are engaging in [Domain Name Frontrunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_front_running) finding out if a domain is available is doable from the command line. 

For example, to check if google.com is available just execute the following command:

	Whois google.com

In my next post I will go over creating a digital ocean droplet.
