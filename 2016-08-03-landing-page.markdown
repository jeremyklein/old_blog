Here it is, the obligatory, first post of my personal blog.

I'm still trying to figure out exactly what kind of content I plan on putting here, so I guess I'll start with my motivations for starting.

# Practice

Being able to communicate effectively is an incredibly powerful skill. While face to face meetings can solve alot of communication issues, sometimes being in the same place at the same time is just not practical. Just like any skill, writing gets easier with practice. I am resolving to post here frequently, so that I can continue to work on my communication skills.

# Accountability

I'm sure everyone can relate to the "weekend project" that you attack full bore, only to get wrapped up in the other obligations of life and never get to the finish line. By writing about the projects that I am working on, I'll have an extra kick in the pants to make some progress. Also, the extra documentation will make it much easier to revisit a project after some time has passed.

# Deeper Understanding

Playing with new technologies is always fun, but the value comes from the new knowledge gained. Describing what I learned will help me flesh out my understanding.

Hope you guys enjoy!
